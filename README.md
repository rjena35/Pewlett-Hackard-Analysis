# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the eligible employees that can participate in an upcoming mentorship program. We will look at the retiring employees who are still currently working with Pewlett-Hackard.

## Results
More than half the potential retiring staff (50842 individuals) are in senior roles within the company, making a rough 71% out of all the retiring staff.

We chose to target employees still with the company, and who was born in the year 1965, as it is presumed that individuals born this year are of age to get ready to retire

### Summary
As a result of the analysis, 1549 employees are eligibile for the mentorship program. This would correlate to the number of positions that would need to be filled, assuming that each eligible staff member decides to remain and assit in the program.

With the large number of senior positions among retirees, the next generation of employees will have to step up sooner rather than later to fulfill the roles that will open up.
